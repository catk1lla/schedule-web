# Schedule Web

> –ü–æ–ª–Ω–∞—è –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º: —Å–º. `README.ru.md`.

Adaptive single-page schedule viewer for alternating parity weeks. The app runs directly in the browser via the CDN-hosted React 18 runtime and uses inline Babel compilation for JSX. It keeps a compact footprint while offering persistent filters, theme controls, and multilingual UI copy.

## Highlights

- üìÖ Odd/even week awareness with automatic Moscow time detection and memoised date handling.
- üéØ Persistent filters for subgroup, class type, and day with keyboard-friendly controls.
- üé® System/Light/Dark theme cycle, animated current class state, and responsive layout down to small screens.
- üåê Bilingual interface (Russian/English) with quick language toggle and document `lang` updates.
- ‚ôø Accessibility passes: focus-visible styling, descriptive ARIA labels, reduced-motion handling, and error boundary fallback.

## Quick Start

1. Install a simple static server if you do not already have one:
   ```bash
   npm install --global serve
   ```

2. From the repository root, launch either of the recommended servers:
   ```bash
   npx serve . --listen 5173
   # or
   python3 -m http.server 5173
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in a modern browser and hard-refresh after edits so Babel recompiles the inline JSX.

## Project Layout

- `index.html` ‚Äì Minimal bootstrap that links React/ReactDOM/Babel from pinned CDN versions and mounts `app.jsx`.
- `app.jsx` ‚Äì Schedule data, React hooks, translation tables, and UI components.
- `styles.css` ‚Äì Theme tokens, layout rules, and responsive behaviour.
- `.editorconfig` ‚Äì Shared formatting baseline (LF endings, 2-space indents).
- `CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äì Release notes and verification checklist.

## Development Notes

- Keep helper functions close to the top-level hooks in `app.jsx`.
- When editing data arrays, preserve property order (`day`, `pair`, `time`, ‚Ä¶) for easier diffs.
- Use single quotes inside schedule data; maintain trailing semicolons and two-space indentation.
- New UI text should be added to both language dictionaries (`TRANSLATIONS`) and referenced through `useTranslation()`.
- For accessibility changes, audit keyboard navigation and screen-reader labels; any new animation must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Manual QA Checklist

After changes, confirm the following in both languages:

1. Toggle parity (`–ê–≤—Ç–æ`, `–í—Å–µ`, `–ù–µ—á—ë—Ç–Ω–∞—è`, `–ß—ë—Ç–Ω–∞—è`) and ensure the list updates.
2. Switch subgroups, class types, and weekdays; reload the page to verify filter persistence.
3. Cycle interface theme (System ‚Üí Light ‚Üí Dark) and check the URL hash navigation from the footer.
4. Switch themes and language on mobile and desktop viewports.
5. Inspect the console for React warnings‚Äîtreat any new warning as a blocker.

## Contributing

Please update the changelog with every user-visible change and document manual test steps in pull requests. Keep commits focused with short, imperative messages (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd language toggle to header‚Äù).
